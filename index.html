                    <p class="lead">Healink was designed to cater to users who have restricted diets due to their medical issues or illnesses. Many users struggle to find recipes or safe foods they can eat while on these restricted diets, and ultimately end up losing their nutrition due to eating only a small handful of foods everyday they feel is safe.  Healink has a recipe finder and filter that helps the user to find recipes that cater to their restricted diets. It also has multiple registered dieticians a user can opt-in to receive a specialized diet plan made just for them, or simply create diet plans for themselves at no extra cost. The app also includes a supplement and medication reminder, and plenty of filters that range from an illness to what kind of ethnic food they’d be searching for.  Healink was designed to help our users when they’re feeling lost and hopeless in their healing journey. Healink is the missing link in your healing journey.</p></div>

We have observed that our product may be overwhelming with information, or not specific enough to their condition, which is causing our users to seek out other apps or sources for help in managing their diet, which in turn does not solve the user's struggles. How might we improve Healink  so that our users are successful in having their dietary and lifestyle needs met?</p>

                        <p class="lead textContent p-5">To help us better understand our users, we conducted an 8 question survey asking what kind of apps they currently use for dietary needs, if they have any conditions that restrict their diets, what kind of features they would want in a dietary app that centers around their condition, and whether they’d feel more inclined to using an app that has a certified dietician giving them a diet plan.

                        We also conducted several interviews with users who have dietary restrictions based on their conditions. Our objective questions were:
                        
                        What are our user’s goals and motivations when it comes to health?
                        
                         What are our user’s pain points when it comes to using fitness apps, health apps, and dietary tracking apps?
                        
                        What are our user’s struggles when it comes to their diet plan due to ethnic cultures?
